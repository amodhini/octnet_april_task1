            the blossoms turn into a darker pink over time. The fresh leaves are coppery brown.In the case of early blooming trees,
             the fresh leaves usually do not appear until after full bloom, which gives the trees an attractive, homogeneous look while
              they are in full bloom. In case of later blooming trees, the leaves usually appear before the blossoms, giving the trees a
